`Nonconvex.jl` is a package with implementations and wrappers of a number of nonconvex constrained optimization algorithms and packages making use of automatic differentiation. Zero, first and second order methods are available. Nonlinear equality and inequality constraints as well as integer constraints are supported. A detailed description of all the algorithms and features available in Nonconvex can be found in the [documentation](https://mohamed82008.github.io/Nonconvex.jl/stable).
